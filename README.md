## About

Project of a calculator done by me, Ali hourag. Hierarchy of operation is studied with natural numbers and decimals. It can handle large operations with multiple numbers and operands.
<br/>
* It does have light / dark mode!
* Shows you your calculations record!
* You can change the display numbers through clicking on the keyboard!
* It studies possible errors, like not closing parenthesis, not being able to add more than one zero before a coma, not being able to concatenate operands that make no sense like ++ and much more!
